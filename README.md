## Business problem

An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry 
professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the 
courses land on their website and browse for courses.

The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like 
Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or 
fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form 
providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. 
Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads 
are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. 
Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The 
typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%.

## Business Goal

Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each 
of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. 

A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas 
a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted. 

There are some more problems presented by the company which your model 
should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so 
you will need to handle these as well.

## Solution

The complete solution is given in the well documented python file. Please run all the cells to get the solution. Please note that the dataset should be present in the same directory.
